# Welcome to Advanced Lighting System for FiveM!

ALS is a spin off of FiveM ELS by MrDaGree. With ELS being so outdated and no one wanting to revive it, I decided to make a similar system from scratch. The project was started on May 8, 2024 and is currently still being developed. 

At this time, the resource is available to the public; however, is missing some key features in early development. Please stay tuned to see more updates overtime!
